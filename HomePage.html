          <P class="paragraph-1-2">Renewable energy is generally defined as energy that is collected from resources which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal energy. Renewable energy often provides energy in four important areas: electricity generation, air and water heating/cooling, transportation, and rural (off-grid) energy services. The United States currently relies heavily on coal, oil, and natural gas for its energy. Fossil fuels are nonrenewable, that is, they draw on finite resources that will eventually dwindle, becoming too expensive or too environmentally damaging to retrieve. In contrast, 
          renewable energy resources—such as wind and solar energy—are constantly replenished and will never run out.</P>

      <h3 id="fossil-fuels">Fossil Fuels</h3>
        <P class="paragraph-1-2">
        Fossil fuels are created from the remains of organisms from millions of years ago being pressurized and dehydrated and eventually turning them into coal, petroleum, oil, and natural gas. These substances when burned produce steam which spins turbines, producing electricity. Being made from the remains of organisms from an earlier time,the supply of fossil fuels is limited and will eventually run dry.

            Burning coal is the leading cause for smog, acid rain, and toxic air pollution.
